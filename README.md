Coursera Specializations
------------------------

*   [Cloud Engineering with Google Cloud Professional Certificate](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.coursera.org/professional-certificates/cloud-engineering-gcp&sa=D&ust=1593061441616000)
*   Do not take the [Architecting with Google Compute Engine](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.coursera.org/specializations/gcp-architecture&sa=D&ust=1593061441617000) course

*   This specialization is a proper subset of the Cloud Architecture with Google Cloud Professional Certificate specialization.

*   [Data Engineering with Google Cloud Professional Certificate](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.coursera.org/professional-certificates/gcp-data-engineering&sa=D&ust=1593061441617000)

*   Even though this is a separate certificate, taking it is highly recommended.
*   Most importantly it covers Pub/Sub, BigQuery, Bigtable, and Cloud Storage in depth.

*   [Architecting with Google Kubernetes Engine Specialization](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.coursera.org/specializations/architecting-google-kubernetes-engine&sa=D&ust=1593061441618000)

*   If you are familiar with Kubernetes and GKE, taking this course separately may not be required but still recommended.

*   [Cloud Architecture with Google Cloud Professional Certificate](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.coursera.org/professional-certificates/gcp-cloud-architect&sa=D&ust=1593061441618000)

*   This specialization is a must as it covers all topics in the exam.
*   The first course of all these specializations is the same course, a quick introduction to GCP resources and services.
*   Completing this course takes between 2 to 8 weeks depending on how much time you spend per day.
*   Refer back to the material once you are ready for the exam.
*   Rewatching the last course of this specialization is highly recommended in the last few days prior to the exam.

Official Study Guide
--------------------

*   [Professional Cloud Architect Study Guide](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://read.amazon.ca/kp/embed?asin%3DB07YW39WJN%26preview%3Dnewtab%26linkCode%3Dkpe%26ref_%3Dcm_sw_r_kb_dp_Zwz3Eb62YKJZW&sa=D&ust=1593061441619000)

*   A must and the absolute first priority, especially for the last few days prior to the exam.
*   Reading twice is recommended, the first time can be chapter by chapter, at the same time with studying the same topic as each chapter.

*   For instance, if you are focusing on storage options, you can read the chapter on storage at the same time as taking the Coursera course on that topic or reading the official docs.

*   It has a plethora of questions that are very similar to the actual exam.

*   12 chapters, each with 12 to 15 review questions.
*   A practice exam (prelude to the book, you can save it for the end)

*   [Associate Cloud Engineer Study Guide](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://read.amazon.ca/kp/embed?asin%3DB07Q8BXDST%26preview%3Dnewtab%26linkCode%3Dkpe%26ref_%3Dcm_sw_r_kb_dp_Xwz3Eb23RXSMN&sa=D&ust=1593061441620000)

*   Only if you are done with the Cloud Architect Study Guide and you either have more time or don’t feel confident in some of the topics that are covered in this guide.

*   [Professional Data Engineer Study Guide](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://read.amazon.ca/kp/embed?asin%3DB086Q6V6G6%26preview%3Dnewtab%26linkCode%3Dkpe%26ref_%3Dcm_sw_r_kb_dp_1wz3EbNQR8RR6&sa=D&ust=1593061441621000)

*   Only if you are done with the Cloud Architect Study Guide and you either have more time or don’t feel confident in topics such as data pipelines, data ingestion, storage options, serverless and fully managed data processing solutions such as Dataproc, Dataflow, BigQuery, Data Fusion, Data Studio, Bigtable.
*   If you already have taken or plan to take the Data Engineer certification very soon, obviously this becomes a must.

*   There are other online exams but beware that some of them provide non-official answers that are incorrect and misleading. Better to stick with the official practice exams and the study guide.

*   [Google Cloud Certified Professional Cloud Architect](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.whizlabs.com/google-cloud-certified-professional-cloud-architect/&sa=D&ust=1593061441624000) ( Whizlabs practice exam, take at your own risk as some answers they provide seemed incorrect to me)

Official Docs
-------------

*   The All Concepts part of each resource or service in GCP docs is the best place to start.
*   The URL scheme is as following where $SERVICE is a GCP resource or service (such as compute, vpc, dns, cdn)

*   [https://cloud.google.com/$SERVICE/docs/concepts](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/concepts&sa=D&ust=1593061441625000)

*   The most important ones

*   [Concepts | Compute Engine Documentation](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/concepts&sa=D&ust=1593061441625000)
*   [Concepts | VPC](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://cloud.google.com/vpc/docs/concepts&sa=D&ust=1593061441625000)
*   [Concepts | Cloud IAM Documentation](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/concepts&sa=D&ust=1593061441626000)
*   [Concepts | Cloud Storage](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/concepts&sa=D&ust=1593061441626000)
*   [Concepts | Cloud SQL Documentation](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://cloud.google.com/sql/docs/concepts&sa=D&ust=1593061441626000)
*   [Concepts | Kubernetes Engine Documentation](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/docs/concepts&sa=D&ust=1593061441627000)
*   [BigQuery documentation](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs&sa=D&ust=1593061441627000)
*   [Concepts | Cloud Datastore Documentation](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://cloud.google.com/datastore/docs/concepts&sa=D&ust=1593061441627000)

*   Docs usually show the equivalent gcloud command or in some cases the Terraform code.

*   Looking at the actual gcloud commands and compiling a list of the most important commands can help with memorizing the concepts.

*   The exam does have questions about the command line and flags for each service but having a general understanding of each service is enough for answering most of them.
